### A Fairy Tale

#### 0. The opening words

Dragons are always evil and fierce, and the brave are always bright and righteous. For in the end it is the brave man who survives, not the dragon. Because that's how the storyteller tells it.

Once upon a time, there was a kingdom, a princess, a dragon, and a brave man. It's like a beautiful tale of good triumphing over evil and ending happily ever after. 

#### 1. A Dragon’s Appearance

The kingdom is a peaceful and tranquil kingdom, but the princess is not a quiet and polite princess. The princess was the king's only child, Mia. She was loved by the whole kingdom, and as a child she had been spoiled. Her request was an order, not to be disobeyed. She had grown tired of eating delicacies and had never set foot outside the castle. All her demands were met, but she felt more and more dissatisfied and didn’t know why. 

She lay in a cradle on the top of the castle's highest tower, and drove away all her servants. The sun shone on her face, and she was nearer to it than anyone else. but still she could not really touch it. She shouted defiantly, “the sun, disappear!” There really was a dark shadow, blocking out the sun. When she looked closer, it was a dragon. She had learned about dragons from the children's book, they are evil and ferocious cannibal devil. But she thought she was the princess loved by all, so the dragon should obey her command also. “Dragon, get down!” A strange idea came to her. “Take me away!” The dragon flew low to the tower and looked curiously at the strange little creature.  “What?” “I say, take me away, let's go! “Mia was not afraid at all, for she thought the dragon would not dare eat her if she cried. 

For a long time, the dragon, Otto was living along. Once in a while, he met hunters and farmers who went up the mountain, but scared them away before they could speak. On this trip away from home, he happened to pass by where these little creatures lived, and there was one little creature to follow him. Though he was used to living alone, it was better than nothing. 

So, with Otto's help, Mia climbed onto his body and lay on his back. “Fly, dragon!” Mia pointed excitedly into the distance. Otto took Mia and flew up the castle, out of the kingdom, out of the place where she had lived for seventeen years. 

Otto took Mia back to his home in a cave on the border of the kingdom between the forest and the mountains. Mia opened her eyes wide and looked at Otto's home. It was nothing like the fairy tale books, no wandering undead, no black castle, just a cave with straw mats and hidden sweet tree roots.

Mia smelled something sweet and she was hungry. She asked something to eat, then Otto took out his favorite sweet tree roots. How could Mia eat the roots of the sweet tree that alkaline earth still in it? Mia began to cry, but when she saw that Otto was not frightened, she apologized and offered the food.  She cried even more, biting her lower lip and staring at Otto, silently covering her mouth and crying. Otto was unmoved. A dragon doesn't have tear glands, so he can't understand the noisy behavior of this little creature. 

“Your…… your eyes are leaking,” said Otto.

“It's called crying,” said Mia, turning her tears into laughter. “Humans cry when they're sad or when a wish doesn't come true.  Crying helps make a wish come true.” 

At this time, Mia has realized that crying is no use for the huge creature in front of her, so she has to say in a pleading tone, “Otto, I am hungry, can you give me something I can eat?”

“What would you like to eat?” Otto asked.

“I want to eat…… hmmm…… baked Paimon and vanilla chocolate!”

“…… What's all this? What is chocolate?” Otto can barely understand these words. 

“Well…… it's the dark, soft and sweet……” She found a large piece of chocolate in her pocket, unwrapped it, and threw it into Otto's mouth.  “Well, that's it.” 

The chocolate was gone in a moment in Otto's jaws, and Otto had not yet fully tasted it. But just a little taste, but make Otto never forget. Too excited, Otto sneezed. The sneeze appeared to Mia to be a roar of rage, and she fell down on the ground in horror.  “Don't, don't eat me.  I can't sing, dance, or tell stories, but I can. . . sorry I only very cute!”

“You have no need to afraid.  I don't eat animals.  You animals are too salty to eat. Sweet tree roots are the best……” 

Finally, Mia ends up eating the soft, sticky core of a sweet tree root. Do not add any seasoning, not as an ornament, but directly as the staple food to eat the sweet tree roots core, do not have a flavor, it is only the fragrance of nature. 

#### 2. The Princess and the Dragon

Back at the kingdom, the princess disappeared. The king was outraged, and the whole country searched in vain. Witnesses have provided clues that a dragon flew over the country at the time of princess disappearance. The dragon must have taken the princess! The king ordered the recruitment of brave men who could kill Otto and save Mia. But feared by the power of Otto, no one answered until a brave man, Noland arrived. Armed with the best of swords and mounted on the fastest of horses, Noland came to the borders of the kingdom. He searched all around the kingdom, but still no news of the princess or the dragon. 

Meanwhile, Mia is living a simple and happy life. Otto made a small hole in the bottom of the cave wall.  It was Mia's new home. When Mia was hungry, Otto would peel sweet tree roots for her, crush walnuts for her, fish for her……They went to a lot of places, built a candy house by the sugar lake, ate barbecue with the flames that come out of Otto after eating peppers on the top of the snow-capped mountains, and even saw two thousand years of flowering equinox flowers. Sometimes Mia went rock climbing. She tried to climb more and more steep mountains. Protected by dragons, it’s no need to fear of boulders or falling down streams. 

In the laughter, Mia gradually understanded, before she was not satisfied, is to come out to see. She was brought up in the palace, and learned everything she knew about nature from books. She wanted to experience the nature described in books. She wanted to see for herself the lines in the bark of trees, the wings of butterflies; she wanted to taste the green of wild fruit, the light of sweet grass; she wanted to hear the birds and cicadas sing; she wanted to smell the sweet fruity flowers. She wanted to stretch out her hands in the running stream, grab a handful of limpid water, throw it into the air, and sprinkle it on her face. 

“Thank you. “Beside Otto, the sleeping princess murmured to herself. 

In the beautiful wild life, Mia became more beautiful and healthier. She learned to sleep on her own, to cook, to bathe, to do laundry, to pick fish bones, to peel fruit, and so on. More importantly, she learned to be independent, to be grateful, to be equal, to love. 

Unconsciously, Mia will be eighteen years old. She remembered that her father had promised her a surprise on her eighteenth birthday. She is homesick. Otto, I think……” “Huh? “ “I want to go home.” “Oh.” “Take me back tomorrow.” “Well.” Otto swallowed the words, “will you come back?” She did not belong to himself. 

A dragon should be alone. Too much care would only lead to misfortune. 

Otto went to the abyss, fought with the abyssal monster, grabbed the pearl that made Mia moved, and gave it to her as a parting gift. They dug out the wine of sweet tree roots in the crater and drank it until midnight. At night, they had a long, sweet, beautiful dream.    

Waking up, and it's time to go. Otto took Mia to the borders of the kingdom. Before Otto put Mia down, Mia began to chatter, “You need to sleep well when you get back. There is no need to refrain from grunting. The rest of the sweet tree roots wine cannot be stolen to drink, wait for me. I don't want the Pearl any more, don't fight with the abyss monster. In my room there are some candy nuts and chocolates, you can eat them……” The sound of horses' hooves was heard. Mia stopped talking and told Otto to go quickly so that he would not be found. Otto is about to fly away, but heard behind Mia shouted, “dear Otto!” Otto turned around. Mia's eyes filled with tears, and she tried to hold them back. 

“Humans cry when they're sad or when a wish doesn't come true.  Crying helps make a wish come true.”

Well, she wished now…… “Three days later, dragon, come and pick me up. The same place, ok? “Otto gave a long squeal of delight as a sign of agreement, and then turned and sped away. 

#### 3. Break into the deepest forest and bring Mia back

Noland was riding along the border when he heard the cry of a girl and the roar of a dragon. He hurried there, and saw the distant dragon and Mia with tears on her face. Fortunately, it came in time, or the beautiful and kind princess will be eaten by the evil and ferocious dragon, Noland rejoiced in his heart.

Noland escorted Mia back to the castle. Mia is back. The king was overjoyed and held a grand party. During the ceremony, people expressed sympathy for Mia's suffering, expressed happiness for Mia to come back, praise for Noland, and resentment for the dragon that captured Mia. Mia tried to explain the dragon's friendliness, but it was believed that the dragon had cast evil magic on her.

In the party, Mia mentioned the surprise of her eighteenth birthday. But the king had been so busy with her disappearance that he did not remember it. But the king soon had an idea, and this was the best present he could think of.  “Your eighteenth birthday present is -- Noland! He repelled the monster and saved you from the dragon.  He is the hero of the kingdom! Together, he can protect you all the time. He will be able to protect you when Otto invades again!” “Otto is not bad! I don't need someone to protect me!” Mia cried, obstinately but feebly. “Oh, my pitiful girl, you must be under the control of the dragon!” The king gave a sigh, and looked at Mia with tender and sad eyes. “Don't worry, my girl! Noland will kill the dragon and get you out of its control!” The king didn’t want her to make a fool at the party, so ordered his servants to take the princess to her bedroom. When a person is considered crazy, anything she says against the perception or will of others, even the fact, will be taken as proof that she is crazy, even though she was a princess. No one can understand her. Even her servants looked at her with pity. It was as if the whole world had deserted her.

Three days later. Except for the unpleasant birthday party, Mia was locked in her bedroom for several days until she married Noland. But today is the day when Otto came to pick her up. She hoped that Otto would not come, for the castle had been on guard and had laid many traps; but she also hoped Otto would come and take her away, away from the place where she had been disappointed.

She heard a noise outside the window. Could it be Otto? She leaned out of the window and looked around, but there was no dragon. She suddenly found that she can go through the window, so she got out. Climbing the walls of the palace, with its ornate reliefs, was not difficult for she who had played on the steep cliffs. She climbed on to the roof, but still she did not see Otto. She was going up to the tower at the top of the palace. There were many steel ropes in the castle to defend against Otto. She found one that connected the tower with the palace and climbed up. 

The rope cut Mia's hands. She was absorbed in pain that she did not even hear the wind, the siren, the explosion, or the shouts of Noland behind her. An arrow flew past Mia. It didn't shoot her, but it scared her. She fell from the rope. Noland ran up to the rope and grabbed Mia's hand, but it was too late. 

Mia fell in the air, she closed her eyes in fear, and called to Otto in her heart. Then she landed on the back of a huge, warm creature. “Dragon!” She shouted happily.  “Go! Be careful! Get me out of here!” When Noland saw that Otto had captured Mia, he was so worried that he jumped off and jumped on Otto. However, he could not stand because he was not used to the rhythm of Otto's flight, so he fell off Otto's back and landed on the top of the stable. While Otto was still flying under the ropes, Noland men rode after it. I must catch up with Otto and save Mia, Noland made up his mind that he should not disappoint the people's affirmation and trust in him. 

An arrow with powder came and hit Otto, and exploded on Otto. Otto let out a scream and turned to look at Mia. The blast stunned Mia and threw her off Otto's back. Noland leaped from his horse and caught Mia in the air. Otto was relieved to see Mia landing safely. Otto wanted to go away, but he made an appointment with Mia.  Today, he wanted to take her away. Noland put Mia on the horse and let the horse carry her to the castle. “I will never let you hurt Mia!” Noland raised his sword and turned to face Otto. Otto did not care.  He only saw Mia. But Noland did not give in. Finally, Noland stood in front of Otto at the entrance of the underground palace. Only fighting. A brave and a dragon, two creatures with the same firm belief and the mission must be completed, in order to use their own way to protect the same person, launched a life-and-death struggle. 

#### 4. Dragons don't Have Tear Glands

Otto was defeated. Maybe it is the dark wound left by losing the battle with the abyssal monster, maybe it is the wisdom and unity of human beings, maybe it is the care that a dragon should not have. 

“Humans cry when they're sad or when a wish doesn't come true.  Crying helps make a wish come true.”

Otto just wanted to fulfill the agreement and make the little creature happy. Otto wanted to cry, but Otto had no tear ducts. With the sword into the neck, blood flow and blurred Otto's eyes. If it is blood for the tears shed, the desire, will it come true? 

Mia woke up and found herself lying on the bed in her bedroom. The physical pain told her, before all, not a dream. Otto…… have he got away? Voices outside the window led her to the window, but the scene below stung her eyes. Otto's head was cut off, and blood splashed all over the ground. The bright red hue, like a cross spike, pierced her heart. Noland stepped on Otto's head with one foot and proudly held up the sword covered with dragon blood. The people swarmed about like stars and the moon, rejoicing, worships, singing the praises of Noland. Mia shouted at the top of his lungs, but no one paid any attention to her. She cried, as if she was alone in the world as helpless. 

“Humans cry when they're sad or when a wish doesn't come true.  Crying helps make a wish come true.”

She cried, then her wish, will it come true? 

“Dragon, please, come back to life……

“Dragon, will you do the barbecue with me again? I won’t put pepper in your nose again……

“Dragon, will you sleep in the cave with me again? I won't let you snore too much……

“Dragon, will you have chocolate with me again? I'll leave you the biggest piece……

“Dragon, would you like to fish in the river with me again? I've learned to pick fish bones by myself…… 

“Dragon, will you come with me to Sugarloaf Lake again? Our candy house, we haven't finished eating……

“Dragon, will you take me to the mountains again? Without you, I wouldn't dare……

“Dragon, will you get me out of here? I won't leave you again! Next year's birthday, I want to spend with you! We're going to make a very very big cake, big enough to fill your mouth. We will use chocolate as the germ, butter on it, sweet grass on it, live sweet tree roots wine on it, bright pearl as the candle, sugar tree fruit as the ornament……

“……”

But no one could listen to her now.

The king received and gave many gifts to Noland, and rewarded Mia to Noland. Noland swears that he will guard Mia who has gone crazy because of Otto's evil magic. Mia did not want to see anyone, and she no longer smiled at anyone. Mia became fond of eating only sweet tree rootss with no ingredients. Mia was always alone at the top of the highest tower of the castle, watching the sun, waiting for a huge creature to hide the sun and take herself away. 

Mia learned before the appearance, proud capricious shout, “the sun, disappear!” Otto did not appear. “Dear dragon, you must be kidding me, aren't you? You must be hiding, waiting to see how anxious I am.” Mia climbed up the fence on the roof, looked up at the sky, and strode along the edge of the fence. She does not feel afraid, because she is a collection of thousands of loves, is a princess with the protection of Otto. She missed her foot and fell. She closed her eyes and waited for the giant creature that would catch her every time. “Dragon, you will show up in time to catch me, won't you?”

#### 5. The end

Later, Noland came to the throne. As a dragon killer hero, he was loved by the people. The sad princess of a few years ago doesn't matter, no one cares. Later on, just one more fairy tale. In the fairy tale, the evil and ferocious dragon robbed the beautiful and kind princess, the bright and righteous brave man killed Otto and rescued Mia. They lived together, happily like a fairy tale.
